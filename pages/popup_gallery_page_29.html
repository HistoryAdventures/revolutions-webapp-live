                    This image gives an excellent - albeit satirical - impression of the opinion the
                    first colonizers of Australia were held in.
                    In reality, a proportion of the criminals sent to the other side of the world
                    were actually held on largely trivial charges.

                    This painting offers a picturesque idyll of colonial life in nineteenth century

                    The “Gold Rush” is in full effect, as the European settlers can be seen to

                    there is not an aboriginal in sight, while the contrast between verdant green

                    The Kongouro from New Holland, George Stubbs (1772)
                </h4>
                <p class="culper-ring__texts__subDesc text-decoration-none">
                    This oil painting by George Stubbs is the first verified depiction of an
                    Australian animal in western art.
                    It was based on the inflated skin of an animal (unfortunately not a living
                    Kangaroo) collected by Joseph
                    Banks, who had been a part of Captain Cook’s first voyage of discovery,
                    encountering the east coast of
                    Australia in 1770. The Kongouro as depicted by Stubbs looks only passably
                    similar to how we know Kangaroos
                    to look, but the painting captures the sense of mystery and excitement felt at
                    the prospect of a new world
                    to be explored.

                    Beer Street and Gin Lane, William Hogarth (1751)
                </h4>
                <p class="culper-ring__texts__subDesc text-decoration-none">
                    Part of a pair of prints, here the 18th century English artist William Hogarth
                    turns his scalpel-sharp satirical
                    eye for detail on the depravation that was everywhere visible on the streets of
                    the cities of Britain during the
                    industrial revolution. Produced to support the Gin Act (1750), the artist’s work
                    is not merely a critique of the
                    consumption of the spirit. The streets of the city are crowded, dirty, and full
                    of crime; the more you look, the
                    more you discover. Holding the viewer’s attention is the central figure of the
                    mother however. The sores on her legs
                    suggest syphilis and prostitution, whilst she seems unperturbed by her falling
                    child, concerned only with having another
                    pinch of snuff (tobacco). Although satirical, Hogarth’s work conveys most
                    clearly the push factors that drove people
                    Britain to the new world of Australia. The new world in the southern ocean
                    offered an escape.

                    Published one year prior to the arrival of the First Fleet in Botany Bay, this
                    map of the Australasian
                    region gives an impression of the extensive European surveying that had been
                    underway for years
                    previous to the plans to colonize. Although the map lacks specificity, the shape
                    of the landmasses
                    are easily identifiable. Although Australia represented a New World for those
                    arriving on the First
                    Fleet and the years after, this map makes clear the extent of European
                    exploration in the region.
