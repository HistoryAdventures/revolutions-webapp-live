                <p class="culper-ring__texts__subDesc text-decoration-none"> Paine’s philosophy and
                    power of connecting his ideas to ordinary people saw him have a profound
                    influence on not only the American, but also the French Revolution. This
                    caricature from 1792 shows how Paine (right) was perceived
                    to be a danger to society. Incendiary ideas stack up around munitions, weapons
                    and the devil himself as Paine sows his ideas. Representation in political
                    cartoons such as these testify to how the common people knew
                    who Paine was, and that certain sectors of society wished to vilify him and his
                    ideas.

                    originally published anonymously in this book in 1680. Locke actually considered
                    the
                    ideas that he had committed to the page, which challenged the established
                    political
                    status
                    quo, to be so dangerous that he never acknowledged that he was the author in his
                    lifetime. Imagine writing one of the most influential books in history and never
                    claiming credit for it!

                    General George Washington was desperate for an organized, effective intelligence
                    service to help the patriot war efforts. This was especially true after several
                    of
                    his earlier spies had been captured and executed by the British forces. Here, a
                    page
                    of
                    the Culper Ring’s code book makes clear that Washington eventually achieved his
                    ambition. The left-hand column displays a series of people and places, whilst in
                    the
                    adjacent column there are the numerical and alphabetical
                    codes which allowed the members of the ring to communicate important
                    information. If
                    you look closely, you can see that New York is represented by the numeric code
                    727.
