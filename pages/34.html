                        Fei Hong was a simple man. He worked wood during the day and returned home to his family
                        in the evenings. He was dedicated to his craft, but no matter how hard he worked he
                        couldn’t seem to get ahead. This just wasn’t because of a weak economy or money
                        mismanagement; it was simply how life was. Each day he toiled and sawed as much as he
                        could before returning home, but it was never enough.He wanted to give his family the
                        sort of life he couldn’t afford. Servants, finery from the West, and so many other
                        wonderful things. Little did Fei Hong realize that opportunity was about to come
                        knocking.

                        Little did Fei Hong realize that opportunity was about to come knocking.
                        One night after a long day at work, he was walking home and came across two men carrying
                        boxes. One was large and strong but the other looked as if the wind might blow him over.
                        Exhausted but ever kind, Fei Hong lifted the heavy box from the delicate man and carried
                        it for him.

                    <div>
                        After the delivery, Fei Hong was paid handsomely for his work. In fact, more than twice
                        his typical daily wage. Confused, he asked what it was they were carrying. In response,
                        the scrawny man offered him a handful of black, powdery goop.
                        Fei Hong threw it to the ground, his heart racing. “Opium?” he gasped. “You let me carry
                        opium?!”
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        “We help the foreigners smuggle it into the city. The elite buy it by the cask and we
                        are paid very well for our work,” smirked the weak man. “If you ever decide you want a
                        job, let us know.”
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        Fei Hong hurried away from the drug smugglers and went home with their money in his
                        pocket. Perplexed, he said little to his son and his wife that evening and went to bed
                        early. With money like this, he could afford all the things his family deserved. But he
                        was ignorant of the drug world and only knew it worked in the shadows, and the dark is a
                        frightening place.
