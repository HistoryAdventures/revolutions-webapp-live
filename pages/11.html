                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not a soldier. I will never wield a musket nor face cannon fire. My
                        place is not
                        upon the battlements or racing through the battlefield.

                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a spy, intent on serving my young nation as it bursts from its
                        British womb. I
                        take personal pride in saving
                        it from itself, and yet there are only so many things I can do. I am a woman, a slave,
                        and
                        unworthy in the eyes of so many, but who better to sneak and creep throughout the halls,
                        listening to conversations as I fill bathtubs
                        and stoke up hearths for the chilly evenings?

                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; We have a traitor in our midst. Captain Arnold has been feeding the
                        British
                        information from the front, the recruits, and even from here at home. Arnold is a
                        turncoat and
                        nothing
                        more, but he is also a friend of my master. John Andre is a good man, a rather fine man
                        if
                        you’re asking me despite his support of the British.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; If the rebels knew that my master was speaking with Captain Arnold, they
                        might
                        make an attempt on his life. It would expose me and force other possible turncoats from
                        his
                        home. There is so much chatter at evening events or simple get-togethers. I have heard
                        so much
                        at my position that I have reported
                        to Townsend, to Saratoga, with the hopes of it reaching Washington himself.

                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; This new nation is to be free and though I am a slave, I know that one day
                        that will
                        mean freedom for us, too. For a nation of slavery cannot stand
                        and call itself free. So long as we have collars around our necks and chains around our
                        ankles,
                        our free country has not yet been realized.

                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I wrinkle my nose as I walk into the kitchen. I fetch a serving tray and
                        head back
                        into the drawing room, filled with men and women dressed in finery. My sharp eyes catch
                        a
                        glimpse of the man I’ve been reporting upon and my breath tightens. He sees me watching
                        him and
                        I hurry to look away. I hope, in his
                        arrogance, he’ll just think me stunned by his presence. He’s fought in many battles, and
                        he’s
                        surely accustomed to the ladies, both free and slave, gasping over him.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I glance at him out of the corner of my eye and see his smug, self-assured
                        smirk. I
                        hope it’s the last time I have to endure it.
