                                                    practices. By shedding light on these injustices,
                                                    progressive organizations began to form to improve worker

                                                    legislature in 1892, for example, to prohibit factory work
                                                    for children under the age of 15; this law was eventually
                                                    passed under the Fair Labor Standard Act of 1938. It was
                                                    this same act that created the concept of a minimum wage.
