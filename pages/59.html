                        The CRIME BEHIND THE FORTUNE

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; The conditions seemed to become ever more perilous in the stockyards; even
                        the children worked dangerous meat hoppers that killed the animals and then ground the
                        meat. As a testament to the dangers of this assignment, it was all too much frequency
                        that a high-pitched shriek would pierce the monotone hum of the slaughterhouse. With
                        that sound came the realization that one of the children had been careless with the
                        placement of his hand and had thereby made a grisly mistake, his flesh now imperceptible
                        among the bits of animal meat in the grinder.

                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Three weeks into the investigation, Thomas watched as one and then another
                        immigrant disappeared. Over the following days, notices of their deaths would be
                        released. Was this simply bad luck? Or was something more fiendish transpiring? Thomas
                        asked around, following the leads and listening to the accounts of those who had worked
                        elbow to elbow with the recently deceased.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; All of this led him to the senior-most worker in the company, who was
                        known as “The Butcher.” He was a tall and bulky man, one who could proficiently wield a
                        cleaver. As Thomas prodded the man for information, he broke out into a cold sweat and
                        became visibly rattled.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; “Shut your mouth!” cried The Butcher. “You have no idea what you are
                        talking about and I know nothing of it! Leave me be!”
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; As he whirled on him, cleaver in hand, Thomas babbled apologies and moved
                        away into the shadows. With the Butcher none the wiser, Thomas tailed the man all the
                        way to a manager’s office. The door slammed shut, leaving Thomas in the dark, until he
                        heard the sound of the Butcher’s cleaver thudding into a fresh pile of meat.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas was certain that the police would be at the slaughterhouse the
                        following day, yet it was business as usual with two small changes. The Butcher and the
                        manager were missing. Thomas got along with his day’s work as quickly as he could,
                        cleaning as much as was possible with his pathetic, blood-mottled broom. Then he
                        realized that the room had cleared out as he worked. Was it the end of the work day
                        already? Thomas frowned up at the sun squinting through one squat window near the roof.
                        Time had flown by.
