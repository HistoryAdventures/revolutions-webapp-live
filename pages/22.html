                    &nbsp;&nbsp; According to the calendar of the white invaders, the year is 1795.
                    That is not, though, how we measure time. It is not how we know our world, but they do not
                    care.
                    I sit in the sacred space near the great blue bay. My people, the Eora Nation, have called
                    these
                    lands home for thousands of years. Since the time that we were given the animals,
                    the water, and the lands by our creator gods and the rainbow serpent, we have remained in
                    our home.

                <div>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we face a challenge that we cannot survive. White men from across the sea
                    invade bringing with them
                    sickness and aggression.
                </div>
                <div>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; My Biyanga, the man who raised me, saw the first white men land seven years
                    ago.
                    They came to this very bay on the back of great wooden ships with sails larger than
                    anything he had ever seen. Biyanga had not seen whites before, though he had heard whispers
                    of them before.
                    Their ships had been spotted off the coast some years before.

                <div>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; At first, our people thought these pale people were the ghosts of our
                    ancestors.
                    Clearly, though, these were not the ghosts of those who came before us. “Our ancestors
                    respected the land. These white men do not. No, these white men come to claim our animals,
                    our land, and even our people for themselves. Because of them, my Biyanga is no longer here.
                    The man who raised me died from the illness they brought. These changes that they bring are
                    unwelcome, yet when we fight back we are slain in huge numbers. We do not possess their
                    weapons,
                    those new and terrible dangers that they have brought with them. How can such a small object
                    create
                    so much death so quickly?
                </div>
                <div>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; We do not suffer alone. As their sicknesses take us, so do their animals’
                    illnesses take
                    our hunting game and the predators that hunt with us. Beyond this, they kill every predator
                    they come across to protect their animals. They do not understand that the predator is as
                    important as the prey; or perhaps more so.
                    The predator shows you where to drink and takes you to the game trail. The prey simply are.

                <div>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; But these invaders have no use for the predator. They kill without reason,
                    without mercy, be it animal or human.
                    They see us as no better than the common kangaroo. It is our animals that they stare at, and
                    we do the same
