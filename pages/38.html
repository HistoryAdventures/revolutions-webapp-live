                            Technological developments, powered by the industrial and scientific revolutions of
                            the 19th century, encouraged ever broader colonial horizons for European nations.
                            Better ships, more effective navigation tools, and the desire for expansion and
                            economic exploitation led the European nations to look further afield to the
                            continents of Asia and Australia.

                                                chartered companies, including famous examples such as the
                                                British East India Company (founded 1600 and informally
                                                known just as ‘The Company’) and the Dutch East India

                                                meaning Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie).

                                                These commercial organisations enjoyed special privileges
                                                that were granted by the state. This was typically in the
                                                form of a royal charter. Their growth in number, size, and
                                                significance is directly related to the European exploration
                                                of the New Worlds to the west and east, and the economic
                                                exploitation of the resources they discovered there. Such
                                                was their prominence in certain regions, and the importance
                                                of their economic hold of an area, that these companies
                                                becomes political and imperial organisations, as well as
                                                commercial enterprises. This happened for example with the
                                                British East India Company.

                                                nations meant that the economic policy and goals of the two
                                                were frequently entwined. Frequently, from the 16th through
                                                to 19th centuries, the prevailing beliefs can be categorised
                                                under the term mercantilism. This mindset postulated that
                                                the earth’s resources and wealth were finite, and that a
                                                state’s power depended entirely upon its ability to control
                                                as much of both as possible. It is not hard to understand
                                                how this fed into the ideology of imperial expansion that
                                                fuelled the European nations at this time.

                                                British Crown and the opening of the port of Canton to

                                                an Empire. The island of Hong Kong for instance was occupied
                                                by the British in 1841 during the First Opium War. The
                                                British victory, and their ability to dictate the terms of
                                                surrender, meant that the island was formerly ceded to the
                                                British Empire by the Qing dynasty in 1842. Further British
                                                consolidation of their new colonial acquisition occurred
                                                throughout the 19th century, including its classification as
                                                a Crown Colony in 1843, and the expansion into the Kowloon

                                                With a base of operations in the Far East, the British could
                                                intensify their imperial endeavors in the region. This
                                                included the Treaty of Tientsin in 1860, leading to the
                                                Chinese being compelled to open more ports to the British,
                                                licenses for the British to navigate the Yangtze River, and
                                                a reaffirmation of the legalization of the Opium Trade. Hong
                                                Kong would not be returned to Chinese governance until 1997.
                                                The “prizes” the Europeans won through gunboat diplomacy
                                                were not willingly let go, indicating how significant they
                                                were in terms of economic benefits, and the prestige they
                                                were perceived to offer.

                                                The colonial expansion of European states into the Asian
                                                continent for largely economic reasons was not limited to
                                                merely one nation, nor was it a phenomenon of the 18th and
                                                19th centuries only. Portuguese and Spanish traders had
                                                reached the islands of South East Asia as early as the 16th
                                                century, where their victories over Arab, Chinese and other
                                                Asian forces allowed them to establish a lucrative maritime
                                                empire based upon the movement of goods, notably spices.

                                                With envious eyes cast at the empires of the Iberian
                                                nations, other European states rapidly mobilised. In much
                                                the same way as there was to be a ‘Scramble for Africa’ in
                                                the 19th century, the lucrative lands of Asia were greedily
                                                gobbled up by European colonisers or forcibly opened up to
                                                trade through Gunboat Diplomacy. Notable examples of this
                                                came with the Dutch control of Indonesia, the British
                                                establishing rule in India, and the French conquest of
                                                Indochina (the area roughly equivalent to modern Vietnam,
                                                Cambodia, and Laos). The latter two instance are examples of
                                                what can be classified as “New Imperialism”, which refers to
                                                a change in approach from indirect control, to the formal
                                                establishment of colonial rule over an overseas territory.

                                                effects of this would be felt well into the 20th century and
                                                beyond as colonised states sought independence and to plot
                                                their own course of national destiny.
