                    In this satirical cartoon – the sort typically found in news weeklies like Punch
                    – a
                    man is seemingly strangled by a coil of rubber that culminates in an
                    unflattering
                    profile portrait of a king. A biting critique of European imperialism and its
                    effect
                    in Africa, these types of cartoons reminded those in Europe of the mistreatments
                    that were occurring.

                    Congo River. His efforts unfortunately proved inconsequential – he could not
                    navigate the river in its entirety – and he died later that same year in a town
                    along Congo’s coast.
