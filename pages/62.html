                        Chicago’s Union Stock Yards can be seen as representing both the best and the worst of
                        America’s industrialization boom of the later nineteenth century. While on the one hand
                        they symbolized the ways in which industrialization could streamline business and boost
                        profits, on the other they also came to signify the unjust and corrupt treatment of
                        laborers and livestock.
                    </p>
                    <p>While the first stock yard in Chicago was operating as early as 1848, it was not until
                        the railroad boom in the city over the course of the 1850s and early 1860s that stock
                        yards began to grow in earnest. They developed along these rail lines to facilitate
                        quick transport of incoming livestock to their holding pens. </p>
