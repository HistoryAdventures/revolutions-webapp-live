                                                    Famously, many of the first arrivals in Australia were
                                                    convicts.
                                                    This was a process that had been ongoing since the 17th

                                                    solution. Captain Cook’s discovery of Australia offered just
                                                    such an answer. In reality, the majority of the convicts
                                                    transported were held for petty crimes (serious crimes were
                                                    punishable by death for instance).

                                                    remained in Australia to build new lives for themselves.

                                                        The main draw for European expansion this period was the

                                                        of opportunity. This took on many different forms.

                                                    Encountering the natives of the new lands meant that the

                                                    at first there were attempts at interaction and cooperation,
                                                    this was soon surpassed by exploitation and re-education.
                                                    Indigenous people were compelled to renounce their
