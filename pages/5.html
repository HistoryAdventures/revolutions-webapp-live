                        From out of the early modern period, we now enter a period characterized by the
                        difficult
                        questions that came to the forefront of the people who lived through an era of
                        incredible
                        change. As traditional societies gave way to more
                        dynamic cultures, with the kingdoms of Europe being increasingly replaced by Empires
                        with a
                        truly global focus, the people caught up in this expansion sought to explain their place
                        in
                        this new world. They would ask the questions
                        that, at their heart, challenged the traditional forms of authority in society:
                        Employer,
                        King, and God
