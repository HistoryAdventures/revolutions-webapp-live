                        The Culper Ring was a secret group of patriots who carried out espionage on the British
                        forces during the American Revolutionary War. Believing in the ideals of the Revolution,
                        the
                        Culper Ring operated in and around New York to frustrate several dangerous plans of the
                        British. The group worked closely with George Washington and helped the American general
                        stay one step ahead of his opponents in the fight for independence.
                        The scene is set for subterfuge: come and uncover the spies that helped win American
                        independence.
