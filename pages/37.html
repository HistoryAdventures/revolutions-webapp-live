                        In the 19th century the British were increasingly concerned about their trade imbalance
                        with China. As much as they wanted to export Chinese tea and other luxury goods, the
                        Chinese had no desire for British and European goods; they accepted silver and precious
                        metals only. To circumvent this, the British used opium grown in their Indian
                        territories. Once smuggled into China – where it was valued for its medicinal qualities
                        – the British were able to use opium to purchase Chinese tea and other goods.
                    </p>
                    <p>Highly addictive, the import of opium had a disastrous effect on Chinese society. Chinese
                        attempts to fight back against the opium trade were met with fierce resistance, and
                        eventually war. European naval superiority led to humiliating defeats for the Chinese.
                        The Europeans were then free to dictate imperialistic trade laws to China.</p>
