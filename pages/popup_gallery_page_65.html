                    The Great Union Stock Yards of Chicago surpassed the country, and at times even
                    the
                    world, in their output of butchered meat. As this aerial view reveals, the pens
                    for
                    various livestock stretched far across the landscape, as did the chambers for
                    the
                    slaughter and preparation of the meat.
