                            connecting his ideas to ordinary people saw him have a profound influence on not

                            (right)
                            was perceived

                            devil
                            himself as Paine sows his ideas. Representation in political cartoons such as these
                            testify
                            to how the common people knew
                            who Paine was, and that certain sectors of society wished to vilify him and his
                            ideas.
