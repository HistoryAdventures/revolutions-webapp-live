                        &nbsp; &nbsp; “The Butcher told us about you,” spat a stranger’s voice.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas whirled around to see three men he had never seen before. The
                        speaker rolled up his sleeves as the other two forced Thomas against the disgusting
                        walls.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; “Strange for a janitor to ask so many questions,” the man snapped. “And
                        y’know what else is weird? This here diary of yours.”
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; The man pulled out Thomas’s journal, tapping the cover. Thomas’s stomach
                        sank.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; “See, we hear about you askin’ questions so we go do a little
                        investigatin’ of our own. And all these atrocities you’re mentionin’? Ain’t that a big
                        word for a janitor? Atrocity? Seems that you ain’t a janitor at all!”
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; A fist connected with Thomas’s stomach, knocking the wind from the
                        terrified journalist. But the man with the rolled up sleeves wasn’t done yet.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; “You wanna know what happened to those missin’ folks? Fellas?”
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; The two larger men hauled Thomas from the wall and shoved him face first
                        toward the meat grinder. The whirring blades were only inches from his face. Thomas
                        screamed and tried to pull away, but the men holding him were just too strong.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; “You see those?” asked the speaker of the three. “Seems some workers are
                        clumsy enough to end up in there all by themselves. The result is… ugly. People aren’t
                        so eager to deal with the bodies, so we make’em disappear.”
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Overwhelmed by the unspoken promise of these monstrous men, Thomas could
                        do nothing but whimper. After what seemed like an eternity, they released him and threw
                        him on the blood-soaked floor.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; “Leave, rat. We ever hear of you again, we won’t come for just you. We’ll
                        get your whole family. And you’ll go last, so you make sure you keep your mouth shut.
                        You understand? You get out of town, change what you do for a livin’. Maybe go run a hot
                        dog stand,” the vicious man snickered.
