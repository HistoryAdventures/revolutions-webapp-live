                                Known as a Company painting, these were made by native Indian artists and depicted
                                members of the East India Company as they went about their business. This one is
                                likely a depiction of William Fullerton of Rosemount, who would become mayor of
                                Calcutta in 1757. As Fullerton was the only Englishman to survive the massacre of
                                the English during the war with Mir Kasim of Murshidabad in the mid 1760’s, it is
                                likely that he was an exceptional linguist and enjoyed closer than usual relations
                                with the native Indians. This is certainly suggested by this painting in which
                                Fullerton appears quite at home amongst the locals and engaging in their cultural
                                practices.

                                in the background as well. The wealth that could be generated through the economic

                                diplomacy, made the region popular with all industrialized nations who wished to

                                powers. The traditional Chinese vessel in the foreground is dwarfed by the vast
                                European ship in the centre. European economic imperialism in Asia was predicated on
                                the advantages generated by technological disparities such as these.

                                seeming to extend onwards, indefinitely, both upwards and into the background. The
                                Opium grown in India and harvested there (note that the workers in the image are all
                                natives; British involvement is explicitly not shown), were smuggled into China as a
                                means of circumventing the trade imbalance.
                                Previously, the Chinese had only accepted silver from the western nations for the
                                luxury goods they imported. A desire to leverage a better deal for themselves led
                                the British to use highly addictive opium as a form of payment for Chinese goods,
                                rather than silver and other precious metals. Chinese attempts to stop the import of
                                opium would ultimately lead to the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century.

                                In this engraving, one can see Chinese opium smokers using the highly addictive drug
                                in an opium den. Although opium had been popular previously as a medicinal drug – it
                                had well known medicinal qualities, especially as a pain killer – dens such as these
                                saw the drug used for recreational purposes.
                                One can gain here a sense of how popular the drug was in Chinese society and also
                                the effects it had upon users. One man appears to be trying to support another who
                                may have overused the narcotic. The Chinese government was fearful of the effects of
                                drug use and addiction on society. The abandoned hat and shoes in the centre of the
                                image – traditional signifiers of social status in Chinese society – are a potent
                                reminder by the artist of how the drug could make people abandon pretenses of status
                                and responsibility.

                                including France, Russia, Great Britain, and the United States. The treaties opened
                                yet more Chinese ports to western trade, allowed Christian missionaries to enter the
                                country to evangelize, and one more established the legality of the import of opium.
                                This treaty is also notable for permitting foreign diplomats (legations) in Beijing,

                                led to a permanent western presence in China.
