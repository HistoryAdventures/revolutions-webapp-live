                            The landscape of America was in rapid flux in the late years of the nineteenth
                            century. For as much as these changes added convenience and greater promise to those
                            who had immigrated to the country in search of the American dream, this era of
                            transition also revealed the seedy underbelly of humanity, where greed and
                            aspiration outweighed human decency.

                                                    In the aftermath of the American Civil War (1861-1865), the
                                                    United States entered a period of massive industrialization.
                                                    The American landscape became peppered with new factories
                                                    and mammoth facilities to support the booming industries
                                                    such as steel manufacturing, petroleum refining, and
                                                    electrical plants. Facilitating this boom was the concurrent

                                                    Another key facet to industrial success during this era was
                                                    the mass production of goods. Though the first factory
                                                    assembly line as we know it would not come into being until
                                                    Ford’s Model T automated assembly line in 1913, prior to
                                                    this point factories were scaled to produce record volumes
                                                    of goods (and thereby turn business owners into titans of
                                                    their field). Andrew Carnegie, for example, pioneered what
                                                    would become known as the “Bessemer process” for the mass
                                                    production of steel and thereafter became an incredibly
                                                    wealthy figure in the industry. Very often though, this push
                                                    for greater scale resulted in more perilous working
                                                    conditions and, in the case of places like the Chicago Union
                                                    Stockyards, inhumane treatment of livestock.

                                                    census, for example, counted 171 carpentering establishments
                                                    employing 1,792 employees. By 1890, the same census
