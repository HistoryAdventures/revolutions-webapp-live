                                                    was frequently employed as European nations used their

                                                    Signed in 1842, this peace treaty brought an end to the
                                                    First Opium War (1839 – 1842). The primary aim of the treaty
                                                    was economic; it was designed to remove the strictures
                                                    imposed on trade by the Canton system. Four new “treaty
                                                    ports” were opened up, including Shanghai. Fixed tariffs in
                                                    these ports were also established. Alongside these economic
                                                    benefits to the British, the British demanded a payment of
                                                    six million dollars in recompense for the opium that had by
                                                    confiscated by Lin Zexu in 1839. The treaty also established
                                                    the cession of Hong Kong from China to Britain. The island
                                                    now became a crown colony.

                                                    exploitation. It is easy to understand why this treaty was
                                                    the first of what the Chinese would later call the “Unequal

                                                    (ca.1830). The Canton system was an attempt by the Chinese
                                                    to control trade with Europe by directing all external trade
                                                    to the port of Canton. This is evident from this image where
                                                    you can see the array of western flags billowing over the
                                                    harbor, including the British, French, Dutch, and the United
                                                    States. Note how western in style the buildings in the
                                                    background are, indicating the pervasive influence of
                                                    western culture.

                                                    end of the First Opium War (1757 – 1842), the Canton System
                                                    is the name given to the Chinese system for attempting to
                                                    control imports. All trade was centered on the southern port
                                                    city of Canton (modern Guangzhou), and this was done to
                                                    counter the belief that the country was under threat from
                                                    external influences.

                                                    reluctance to trade in
                                                    anything other than silver, saw the East India Company begin
                                                    to sell opium grown on its Indian plantations, which were
                                                    then shipped into China to be sold for silver. Chinese
                                                    resistance to this policy ultimately led to the First Opium
                                                    War. British victory broke the Canton system, with the 1842
                                                    Treaty of Nanking forcing open other Chinese ports, such as
                                                    Shanghai. Although unique to Chinese society, the Canton
                                                    system provides a clear example of the effects of ‘Gunboat

                                                    drastically, on the basis of another’s military supremacy.
