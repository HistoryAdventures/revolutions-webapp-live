                        &nbsp; &nbsp; John intends to meet with this traitor tonight. It is my heartbreak that I
                        must betray
                        such a good and kind master, but I must believe the rebels will win. Perhaps, with my
                        intervention, I might buy my master some sort of help when the war is over. But
                        that is thinking too far ahead.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; My serving dish empty, so I scoot back into the kitchen for more. When I
                        return,
                        Master John is gone but I glimpse the corner of Arnold’s jacket disappearing out the
                        door. I
                        must hurry to listen
                        in. What gems can I discover for my people, for the cause? Arnold is the one who’s
                        rotten, not
                        John. My information will help the rebels see this.

                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I duck back into the kitchen and drop my serving dish off once more.
                        Quickly,
                        I run through the servant’s stairs toward John’s room. There is a door there that I can
                        hide
                        behind, press my ear against, and listen. I will write down the details later. There is
                        nothing
                        I cannot remember.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; My breath hitching, I stop to remove my shoes at the top step. I shuffle
                        through the
                        darkness, holding my skirts tight. The men are talking, of military strategies and ideas
                        that I
                        don’t fully comprehend. Yet I know that men wiser than me will
                        value these tidbits. I all but hold my breath. My master speaks kindly to this terrible
                        man, the
                        one that wishes so much harm upon my new nation.

                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I hear murmurings of “West Point.” The phrase is oft-repeated. I note it
                        in my mind.
                        Is it just me, or is the light burning brighter… the voices getting closer?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly, the door is ripped open from within. Arnold glowers down at me
                        and snarls,
                        “I knew it! A spy!”
