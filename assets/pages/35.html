                        Nevertheless, on that day, Fei Hong became a part of the British Empire’s illegal trade
                        in the East. Time seemed to stand still as Fei Hong went from smuggler to trafficker.
                        His family enjoyed a comfortable life with two servants and all the finest furnishings.
                        Though his intentions were honest and innocent, the man didn’t know the plague he was
                        unleashing on the streets. However, after several close brushes with addicts, he
                        realized what he was enabling.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        By now, his family didn’t just deserve a better future: they needed it. The drug money
                        fueled their lifestyle and Fei Hong couldn’t reduce them to the woodworking life from
                        whence they had come. When he could no longer cope with the guilt of addicting
                        innocents, Fei Hong turned to the opium pipe himself.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        Now addiction ruled his life, too. The man who had once rushed home to tend to his son’s
                        reading lessons now shouted at his wife and smoked with other traffickers who had fallen
                        victim to the vice. He longed to stop but there was nothing that gave him the feeling he
                        needed. His family became less important as he withdrew further into his need.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        The Chinese government enacted stricter laws that impacted his illegal activities. They
                        would burn massive stashes of opium and increased surveillance on the streets hoping to
                        catch traffickers like Fei Hong. It became much harder to smuggle drugs through the
                        cities, yet Fei Hong could not resist skimming product here and there. Only the richest
                        men could afford opium now, but Fei Hong couldn’t deprive himself. It was out of
                        desperation that Fei Hong stole opium from a shipment destined for a powerful
                        politician, who immediately vowed vengeance.
