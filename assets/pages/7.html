                    These questions, along with many others, made this period one of the most explosive in
                    history. Societies would be powered to new heights by the ingenuity of industrialization
                    whilst they would also crumble to revolution and internal
                    bloodshed. Kings and queens would be killed, and scientists, explorers and philosophers,
                    would challenge ideas that would shake age-old beliefs to their core. From out of this
                    climate of change and challenge we will begin to
                    see the foundations of our modern world and our modern ways of thinking about people and our
                    place in society.
