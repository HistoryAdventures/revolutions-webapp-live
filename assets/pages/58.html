                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas Brown hung his coat by the door and massaged his ink-splattered
                        fingers. Though the day was done, he wasn’t sure he was ready for bed. There was simply
                        too much on his mind.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Deep undercover for a guy like me? he thought to himself as he grabbed a
                        mug from the kitchen cabinet. As a janitor? It’s an incredible idea, sure, but can I
                        pull it off?
                        For a slaughterhouse, the Chicago Union Stockyards were certainly fishy. The Chicago
                        Union was among the pioneers of this large-scale meatpacking trade. The workers were
                        mostly immigrants with many entirely inexperienced at the job. So why had so many been
                        hired?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas’ journalist instincts had piqued his curiosity, which his why he
                        was preparing to follow in those immigrant’s footsteps to scrub walls, rake muck, and,
                        hopefully, find the truth within the Chicago Union.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; “We stab’em, you clean up, y’got it?” asked the scowling man.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; The morning had dawned crisp and bright, yet the slaughterhouse was
                        somehow even colder. Thomas resisted the urge to chatter his teeth. Perhaps the only
                        thing worse than the cold was the stench of death. “Got it, boss.”
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; The scowling man shoved a broom into Thomas’s hands and left. Thomas
                        frowned at the poor, battered thing. There was hardly a bristle left on it, yet he tried
                        to clean as much as he could. People stood in blood and the remains of cattle from ages
                        ago. The packers didn’t seem to notice, but for Thomas, the conditions were abhorrent.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; No matter how much he scrubbed himself at night, he couldn’t get rid of
                        the stench of the slaughterhouse. After the first week, though, he didn’t notice it as
                        much anymore, and as the first week bled into the second he found that his sole driving
                        passion was keeping his journal up to date. Each night he wrote a passage about his day.
                        In it he described what he had seen, what he had heard, and what he supposed was behind
                        each closed door he encountered. His journal would be instrumental in blowing the whole
                        case open when he returned to the newsroom, a point he reminded himself of with
                        increasing frequency as the weeks ground on.
