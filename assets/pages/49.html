                            The Berlin Conference of 1884 marked a key moment in the push for taking over
                            massive swaths of the African content, but annexing portions of Africa was not new
                            to European powers in the nineteenth century. On the contrary, history reveals that
                            the Spanish and Portuguese were already exploring the African coast as early as the
                            sixteenth century, with French forces arriving in the subsequent century.

                            Their central goal was to expand their own national presence under the pretext of
                            imperialism – that is, the desire to further one’s nation by taking over new
                            territories and “reforming” them to a European way of life – but they also saw
                            Africa as an untapped array of natural resources that could support the rampant wave
                            of industrialization that was sweeping Europe. In addition to the resources
                            necessary for industry, Africa also offered a plethora of precious materials such as
                            ivory. As a result, during the 19th century an
                            increasing number of European began to stake claims to areas of the African coast.
