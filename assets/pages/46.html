                          burden. Khari could heed his people’s call or listen to their screams. And so
                          rebellion was an easy choice.
                        </span>
                    <span>
                          Far from Khari, a steamboat had arrived in the Congo. With it came four
                          gun-slinging Americans out for nothing more than money and blood. The leader
                          of the Americans wandered into a trader camp and wrinkled his nose at the
                          stack of corpses, at the slaver waving a barbed whip at rubber collectors. Europe
                          had been sold on the idea that their enforcement was upholding humanitarian
                          values, fighting against the Arab’s slave trade, and bringing Christian morals to
                          the land. It was obviously untrue.
                        </span>
                    <span>
                          “Just another side of the same, dirty coin after all,” sighed the American
                          leader.
                        </span>
                    <span>
                          After a good round of planning, the Americans settled by a bonfire under a
                          clouded sky. Three of them played cards as their leader strummed an old guitar.
                          His voice was gentle and serene, charming all who listened even if they didn’t
                          speak the language. The camp languished in it.
                        </span>
                    <span>
                          When the flames died, he put aside his guitar and settled down into his
                          sleeping roll. He dreamed of all the things his song had left out: the murder, the
                          chaos that lingered in his dark, money-hungry heart. Though they had appeased
                          those in their campsite with their dulcet strumming, the Americans were here
                          for a much more dastardly aim: to silence revolutionaries like Khari.
                        </span>
                    <span>
                          For his part, Khari continued to deal significant blows against the Belgian
                          exploitation of the natives. He broke trade routes, freed slaves, and destroyed
                          encampments. Tales of huge, masked tribesmen spread amidst the foreigners.
                          While Khari’s methods had brought him such victories, unfortunately every
                          attack also brought with it a way for his enemies to recognize the pattern Khari
                          was using. Though Khari expected retaliation, it never came. The tribal leader
                          had no idea who was hunting him, but he could feel their eyes.
                        </span>
                    <span>
                          The next attack Khari planned was supposed to be an easy task. A small cabin
                            housed several slave workers of the rubber trade, and he and his Mongo warriors
                            were on a mission to liberate them. What he found, though, on arrival was a
                            house strewn with butchered slaves, the floors covered with gore. As his
                            stomach sank, Khari heard a barrage of gunfire erupt outside.
