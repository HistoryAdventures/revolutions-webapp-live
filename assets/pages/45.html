                          “Value your position, gentlemen. I remind you that King Leopold has the right
                          to exercise enforcement throughout the Congo due to the Arab’s known practice
                          of slavery with the locals. I am certain that you will succeed in the
                          aforementioned task. Go, the vessel awaits you and your men.”

                    <span>
                          Under the starry night sky of the Congo, Khari sighed as gazed into the
                          distance. His eyes narrowed as he hefted his spear. Though he took no pleasure
                          in the killing of these foreigners, he could no longer ignore their crimes. A
                          wounded man tried to crawl to safety, to freedom, before him.
                        </span>
                    <span>
                          Khari closed his eyes and remembered the smell of burning flesh, the screams
                          of innocent victims, and so many other terrible things that he had witnessed in
                          such a short span of time. He tightened his grip on the spear and loosed it. The
                          man before him gasped, once, and fell silent.
                        </span>
                    <span>
                          Khari retrieved his spear and disappeared back into the brush. The attacks,
                          spearheaded by his tribe, were becoming more successful. Though the enemy
                          had impressive weapons, the spear and knowledge of the land would surely
                          always win out.

                    <span>
                          The strong, well-built man led a tribe of native Mongos that rebelled against
                          the Belgian cruelty in the Congo. With this latest victory, he rescued prisoners
                          and slaves that worked on rubber extraction. Many had wounds, missing fingers,
                          or missing hands altogether, the violent price paid to members of the Force
                          Publique; the dead piled higher than he could endure. He could do nothing for
                          them. It seemed there was no limit to Belgian cruelty.
                        </span>
                    <span>
                          Khari spotted a man who remained behind and walked over to him to find the
                          man staring at a tiny child’s hand lying in the dirt. Khari’s stomach clenched.
                          Perhaps this child had been unable to satisfy the desired quota of rubber for a
                          single day; or, perhaps they had done this to punish the parents of the child. He
                          sank beside the man and mourned with him, for no child - or parent - should
                          have had to cope with such injustice.

                    <span>
                          Above all else, Khari loved his people. He was deeply respected and, in these
                          dark times, his tribe looked up to him for guidance and salvation. Though he had
                          no love for violence, the Belgians would not consider a treaty. The European
                          invaders looked down upon the native Mongos and treated them like beasts of
