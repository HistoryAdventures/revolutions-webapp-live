                                        Spain claimed a small but powerful position along the continent’s
                                        western coast following
                                        the Berlin Conference by emerging as a protectorate of two territories
                                        known as
                                        Rio de Oro and Saguia el-Hamra, later known simply as the Spanish Sahara
                                        (envisioned within the modern borders of Western Sahara). Though
                                        the Spanish met swift opposition from the local Saharwi culture,
                                        Spain was drawn to this region for its incredible abundance of fish.
                                        It was not until the twentieth century that Spain began to trek inland
                                        and
                                        discovered another ample - and incredibly desirable resource: phosphate.
                                        It was the desire to maintain access to this abundant commodity that
                                        kept Spain
                                        invested in the region into the later twentieth century.

                                        Dominating a massive swath of northern and eastern Africa from the
                                        closing years of the nineteenth century until the 1940s, Italy
                                        controlled a footprint that today contains the countries of Eritrea,
                                        Ethiopia, and Somalia along the eastern Horn of Africa as well as the
                                        northern country of Libya. Their draw to the continent began within the
                                        shipping industry, when an Italian company was tasked in the 1880s with
                                        building a coaling station along the shore of the Red Sea to facilitate
                                        passages made possible by the recently constructed Suez Canal. By the
                                        decade following, the Italian government had realized the potential of
                                        east Africa as a space to expand the Italian empire. So, in addition to
                                        gaining control of the territory of Libya, the Italians annexed Eritrea
                                        and Somalia. The rise of fascism in the 1930s proved detrimental to
                                        relations between Italians and indigenous Africans; the fall of
                                        Mussolini and the reinstallation of Ethiopia’s revered emperor, Haile
                                        Selassie, in 1941, marked the end of Italy’s African presence.

                                        Representing one of the earliest European imperialist regimes to move
                                        into African territory, Belgian King Leopold II began finding a foothold
                                        within the region of Congo as early as the 1870s. Hoping to monopolize
                                        access to the area’s incredible resources, among them rubber, Leopold II
                                        officially annexed the area as the “Congo Free State” the aftermath of
                                        the Berlin Conference. Freedom, though, for the people of Congo was far
                                        from the king’s mind as his brutal military troupe known as La Force
                                        Publique were renowned for their insidious tactics - including
                                        mutilation and assault - to keep rubber harvests in line and meeting his
                                        imposed quotas, Leopold II maintained a stranglehold on the rubber
                                        exports from Africa until 1908, when the power of the region was wrested
                                        from his control. The region stayed under the control of Belgium though,
                                        until 1960 when it was officially declared an independent country.

                                        The British controlled almost the entirety of a swath of Africa that
                                        extended from modern Egypt all
                                        the way south to modern South Africa; also held territory within West
                                        Africa. Their initial
                                        domination stemmed from their active role in the slave trade, however by
                                        the dawn of the nineteenth
                                        century they had abolished the practice which resulted in improved
                                        relations. In other parts of British Africa,
                                        this peaceful resolution was contrasted with brutal conflict. This was
                                        the case for South Africa, where the discovery
                                        of diamonds in the 1860s resulted in bloody conflict between the British
                                        forces and those of the Dutch Boers.
                                        The culmination of this conflict was the Boer War which loomed from 1899
                                        to 1902.

                                        In addition to dominating Algeria, France assumed control of
                                        both Tunisia and Morocco in the 1830s, sharing some of the
                                        protectorate rights with Spain. Their goal was to tap into the wealth of
                                        phosphate, which continues today to be one of Morocco’s richest natural
                                        resources
                                        and proves essential to the creation of everything from fertilizer to
                                        house paint.
                                        Around 1850, Africa represented more than half of France’s global
                                        imperial trade
                                        (see graph below).

                                        Germany gobbled up various separate portions of Africa in 1884 but
                                        consumed a total
                                        terrain of more than 800,000 square kilometers. Their largest territory
                                        as German
                                        Southwest Africa (modern day Namibia), which while rich in incredible
                                        resources
                                        from diamonds to fish, was preferred for its expansive (and available)
                                        coastline for trade outpost efficiency. Conflicts between the Germans
                                        and the indigenous Nama peoples brewed as the Germans confiscated local
                                        lands and cattle herds, which resulted in the decimation of the Nama
                                        population in the 1890s.

                                            Portugal was one of Europe’s pioneers in the establishment of trading
                                            outposts along the African coast. In the sixteenth century they laid
                                            claim to the land that today makes up the southern countries of Angola
                                            and Mozambique, but perhaps one of the most striking entanglements
                                            between the Portuguese and indigenous African culture along the “Gold
                                            Coast” (today comprising the stretch across the countries of the Cote
                                            d’Ivoire to Nigeria). Nestled along this coast was the historic Kingdom
                                            of Benin, with whom the Portuguese developed a relatively amiable
                                            business relationship. In exchange for the export of the wealth of gold
                                            and ivory available in the region, the Portuguese also imported vast
                                            quantities of brass that the artists of Benin transformed into an
                                            exceptionally extensive artistic tradition. The Kingdom of Benin was
                                            thus able to keep its independence until the 1897 Benin Expedition
                                            launched by the British brought rampant atrocity, the complete
                                            destruction of the Oba’s Palace, the decimation of Benin City, and the
                                            plundering of much of the kingdom's artistic riches.
