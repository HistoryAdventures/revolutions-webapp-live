                            Relations between the settlers and the natives over the course of the first half
                            century after the arrival of the First Fleet was marked by escalating tensions and
                            increasing violence. As the settlers spread out of the original colonies, more land
                            was grabbed, speeding up the deterioration in relations between the two groups.

                            The British had first hoped to ingratiate themselves with the natives and assimilate
                            them into the British culture (which they believed to be superior). The aim was to
                            use them to help work the newly-acquired land, despite the nomadic traditions of the
                            aborigines, as well as using them as translators to speed-up cooperation and
                            communication. Increasingly violent clashes curtailed these efforts.
